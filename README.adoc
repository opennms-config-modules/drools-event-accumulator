= A Drools event accumulator using the Event Correlator

== Purpose
A set of Drools rules that leverage the existing flap-detection helpers in order
to maintain a count of events received within a configurable interval and emit
an event when the count is exceeded. I am not an expert at Drools, this was primarily
done as a learning exercise and may not follow the rules of best practice or
sanity.

== Installing
 - Enable the `Correlator` in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/services-configuration.xml`
 - copy `drools-engine.xml` to `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/`
 - copy the entire `drools-engine.d` to `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/`
 - modify the `drools-engine.xml` for your desired interval, event count, and event UEIs.
 - add event defintions for the /Rollup events (i.e. uei.opennms.org/test/testtest1/Rollup)
 - cross your fingers and restart OpenNMS

== Usage
As described.  The log output from drools is written to logs/DroolsCorrelationEngine-*.log
The event parms from the triggering event are copied into the rollup event, so it
would probably be helpful if all the event UEIs use the same parms and values,
but we don't actually check for this.
